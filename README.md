# Vention MachineCloud test

This test will consist of building a very simple application which represents a marketplace.

## What you need to build
- [ ] An application using React that will display a list of items that you can add to your cart
- [ ] When you add an item to your cart it should be represented in the UI
- [ ] You should be able to remove products from the cart
- [ ] You must add the ability to rate products with a score from (1 to 5)
- [ ] Provide instructions in the README to launch the application

## Bonus points
- [ ] **Use TypeScript**
- [ ] Implement a backend and persist the state in a database
- [ ] Have a single command to launch the whole application
- [ ] Use the open-source project [stator](https://github.com/chocolat-chaud-io/stator) as a template for your application

Here's an example to give you inspiration of a very simple UI representing the different states of what we're looking for:
